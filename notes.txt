TODO Consider adding time limits to main.go and/or scraper implementations

TODO Collect and record scraping stats: execution time, internal iteration count, seen entries count, unparsable entries count, etc
     Implies recording data in main.go and the scraper itself

TODO Implement scoring: implies Score, MatchedPhrases and TokenTfIdf attributes
     Use the original Lisp spelunker implementation as a guide

TODO Move shared structs into a single file
     Ie Job is used by LinkedIn but would also be used by other job board scrapers

TODO Consider using vendoring to break up the main package into multiple packages (directories)
     Especially relevant if a large number of sources are implemented
